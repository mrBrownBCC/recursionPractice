# Java recursion practice


### The assignment
Complete the 4 recursive methods within RecursionPractice.java .

### Setup command
N/A

### Test command
`gradle test`

### Notes
For all recursive problems, you need to figure out two things - 
1) How can I use the function I have to make progress on the problem? How can my function make the problem smalle?
2) What is my base case? When can I NOT make a recursive call and stop calculating?
